## Alternative Firmware Build: Native Pico SDK

If you prefer working directly with the **Raspberry Pi Pico SDK** and **CMake**, check out the companion project:  
ðŸ”— [zx-rgbi-to-vga-hdmi-PICOSDK](https://github.com/osemenyuk-114/zx-rgbi-to-vga-hdmi-PICOSDK)

This version of the firmware:

- Uses the **native Pico SDK** instead of the Arduino framework  
- Enables more direct control and customization of **PIO programs**  
- Ideal for developers experimenting with low-level video signal processing or custom capture logic
