## Features

### Software

- **Video Output:**
  - VGA output with selectable resolutions: 640×480 @60Hz, 800×600 @60Hz, 1280×1024 @60Hz.
  - HDMI (DVI) resolutions: 640×480 @60Hz and 720×576 @50Hz.
  - Optional scanline effect on the VGA output at higher resolutions for a retro look.
  - "NO SIGNAL" message when no input is detected.
- **On-Screen Display (OSD) Menu:**
  - Full-featured graphical menu system overlaid on video output.
  - Three-button control (UP, DOWN, SEL) with live tuning and save-to-flash support.
  - Quick VGA/DVI toggle via long SEL press (5 seconds).
  - Auto-timeout after 10 seconds of inactivity.
  - See [OSD Menu Guide](docs/OSD_MENU_GUIDE.md) for detailed usage instructions.
- **Configuration via Serial Terminal:**
  - Alternative text-based menu system for headless configuration.
  - Frequency presets for self-synchronizing capture mode (supports ZX Spectrum 48K/128K pixel clocks).
  - Real-time adjustment of all parameters (changes applied immediately).
  - Settings can be saved to flash memory without restart.
- **Test/Welcome Screen**

### Hardware

- **Analog to Digital Conversion:** Converts Analog RGB to digital RGBI.

## Recent Improvements

### Performance Improvements

- **Video Output Optimization**: Streamlined DMA handling for both VGA and DVI/HDMI output modes, resulting in more efficient memory usage and cleaner code structure.
- **Buffer Management**: Simplified buffer switching mechanisms for improved video processing performance.

### Development Experience

- **PlatformIO Integration**: Full PlatformIO support with Arduino framework for easier development and dependency management.
- **Arduino IDE builds**: The project can also be built using the Arduino IDE for those who prefer a simpler setup (requires: Optimization **-O3**, USB Stack - **Pico SDK**).

### Code Quality

- **Settings Integrity**: CRC-32 validation on saved settings — corrupted or uninitialized flash data is detected on boot and automatically replaced with safe defaults.
- **Memory Optimization**: Reduced unnecessary memory allocations and pointer complexity in video output modules.
- **Architecture Refinements**: Better separation of concerns between video input capture and output generation systems.
- **Maintainability**: Cleaner code structure while preserving critical hardware-specific requirements for reliable video processing.
